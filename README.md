## Additional comments
It is my first time using Vue3, TypeScript and writing tests.
Though I did read up about Vue3 and TS before, I essentially had to learn all these in 4 days.
Unfortunately, due to the time constrain, I haven't figured how to mock API calls which would've been great on some of the tests.
